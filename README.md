# Chatbot Web UI

This project is a Gradio-based chatbot application that leverages the power of LangChain and Hugging Face models to perform both conversational AI and PDF document retrieval. The chatbot is capable of handling text-based queries, generating responses based on Large Language Models (LLMs), customize text generation parameters and retrieving information from uploaded PDF documents.
